# Stickers and Links

This project is developed for my mom. Instead of writing a note or URL on a sticky note then stick it on the screen's side, she can just open this web app and do the same thing digitally.


### Key features:
 - Sticky notes has 5 different colors and can be selected when creating
 - Existing sticky notes can be edited, but the color can not be changed once created
 - Editing existed links will only change their display name instead of its url(its url is the display name on default)
 - There's an animation for each creates/delete action to ensure a smooth user experience
 - Data of each note/link are store in json files(notes.json and links.json)
 
 
### Build based on:
 - Node.js \ Express
 - HTML \ CSS \Javascrapts
 - JQuery \ JQuery UI
